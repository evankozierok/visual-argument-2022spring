To start off my gerrymandering visual argument, I have mainly just focused on importing my main assets as well as a bit of coloration on the glass fracture to show what it might look like. I definitely want to do some editing to make the "districts" a little more like districts, as right now its quite apparent as a glass fracture but not necessarily a district map.

I'll mostly devote this space to discussing my next steps, primarily to organize and catalog them for myself:

* As mentioned above, I want to make the glass fracture more distinctly recognizable as political districts. I think some black borders between red and blue would help immensely here as well as connecting or removing some of the little blips of red that can clutter things up. Also, the fracture lines are a bit thin - making them thicker would probably help.
* I need to cut out the main fracture pattern from the blue background - probably some sort of jagged polygon. Probably also swap red and blue, since large districts are often rural and thus red.
* I was thinking about making the central circle black - although not a district color, it would draw attention (think value) and contribute to the idea of a bullet hole pattern.
* I need to overlay this onto the map. I want to desaturate the background a bit so it isn't distracting, and maybe do some light red/blue coloring to give it more of a political map feel. Perhaps use 2020 results for the coloring? Depends if that will end up too red-heavy.
* This doesn't include the textual argument yet, which will probably live at the bottom of the image. I need a catchy call to action. I also want to start thinking about useful links to include in the QR code at the bottom.
