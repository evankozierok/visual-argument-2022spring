# Shattered
### A Visual Argument by Evan Kozierok

## Overview

*Shattered* is a visual argument meant to explore and consider the fragmented nature of politics and democracy in Pennsylvania and beyond. Originally designed as a message to introduce people to the issues of gerrymandering, the scope of the visual extended to a broader consideration of democracy and the divisions it can cause.

## Learn More
The goal of this visual argument is not to serve as an infographic, but rather to draw attention and encourage you to learn more about the issues in American politics. In an attempt to aid that goal, I've provided a number of links and resources with additional information. I encourage you to begin with the topics that speak to you, and to continue your investigation from there. And if what you see compels you to action, then take action!
